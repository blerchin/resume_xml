 			<mission label="Mission Statement">In an era where images empower and enlighten with greater speed and impact than ever before, art and design are taking on new and unexpected forms. My work is an exploration of the systems of meaning that underly visual expression. I build tools and experiences that harness the power of machines while affirming people's ability to empathize and connect, create rather than destroy.
